# YOLOv3-GoogleColab

7/19/2019 - Hey, I just made a video on the QUICKEST and EASIEST way to set up YOLOv3 on Google Colab in *ONE* click, check it out: https://youtu.be/USdaipqgZR8


Hey! What's up, guys! Here's the Google Colaboratory notebook that will, hopefully, help you set up YOLOv3 on Google Colab and get going with it. You'll find here how to install Darknet with YOLO and all its dependencies, including CUDA and OpenCV. Then, I'll be showing how to process videos with it and train your models (which worked like 1000 times faster than my good ol' CPU), as well as how to upload and download your training data and the resulting weights.

Hope you enjoy and get some value out of it!
